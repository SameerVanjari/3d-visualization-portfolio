# 🏡 Immersive 3D Real Estate Portfolio
Welcome to the **Immersive 3D Real Estate Portfolio**, a showcase project designed to provide an interactive and realistic virtual tour experience for real estate properties directly in your web browser. This project is built as a portfolio piece for a Fiverr gig, demonstrating expertise in creating high-fidelity 3D web applications.

### ✨ Project Overview
This application transforms static property listings into dynamic, explorable 3D environments. Users can navigate through virtual spaces as if they were physically present, offering an unparalleled sense of immersion and detail. Leveraging the power of Three.js for 3D rendering and HDR images for realistic lighting, this project aims to set a new standard for online property viewing.

### 🌟 Features
- **Immersive 3D Navigation**: Explore real estate properties in a full 3D environment.
- **Realistic Lighting**: Utilizes High Dynamic Range (HDR) images to provide natural and accurate lighting within the 3D scenes.
- **Interactive Experience**: Users can move around, look at different angles, and experience the property as if they were there.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern Web Stack**: Built with cutting-edge web technologies for performance and maintainability.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React (with Vite)**: A fast and lightweight build tool for modern web projects, paired with the popular React library for building user interfaces.
- **Three.js**: A powerful JavaScript 3D library that makes it easy to display 3D graphics on a web browser using WebGL.
- **HDR Images**: Used for environment mapping and realistic scene illumination, providing a high level of visual fidelity.
- **Plain CSS**: For utility-first CSS styling, ensuring a clean and responsive UI.


### 🛠️ Installation and Setup
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js) or Yarn

#### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
      cd your-repo-name
    ```

    (Replace your-username/your-repo-name.git with the actual URL of your project's GitHub repository.)

2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

3. Run the development server:
    ```
    npm run dev
    # OR
    yarn dev
    ```

    This will start the development server, usually accessible at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is in use). The application will automatically reload if you make changes to the source code.

4. Build for production (optional):To create an optimized production build of the application:

    ```
    npm run build
    # OR
    yarn build
    ```

    The build artifacts will be placed in the `dist/` directory.

### 🎮 Usage
Once the application is running:
- Navigate to the provided local URL (http://localhost:5173 by default).
- Use your mouse or touch gestures to look around the 3D environment.
- (If implemented) Use keyboard keys (e.g., W, A, S, D) or on-screen controls to move through the property.
- Explore different properties via the navigation options (if multiple properties are showcased).
